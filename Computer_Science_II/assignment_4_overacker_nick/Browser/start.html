         Q: What is NickFaux?
      </h3>
      <p>A: It's this Browser. Duh.</p>

      <h3>
         Q: How do I get started?
      </h3>
      <p>A: To browse the web, enter the URL of the website you want to visit in the address bar at the top of the window. Be sure to include http:// at the beginning of the address!</p>

      <h3>
         Q: That sounds like a hassle...
      </h3>
      <p>A: That's not a question.</p>

      <h3>
         Q: Did you do any of the extra credit challenges?
      </h3>
      <p>A: Well... kind of. I didn't handle any heavy-duty tags like anchor or img, but I did have this browser properly handle the BR tag and the P tag, and it treats a few other tags in a special way even though it does not parse them like a regular web browser.
